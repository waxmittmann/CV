      <div class="aboutMeBlurb">
        <p>Since getting my first computer as a Christmas present (an Olivetti 386) I have been passionate about computing. An undergraduate degree in Computer Science reinforced that passion, so much so that I decided to pursue a doctorate. While the academic setting taught me many valuable lessons, I longed to be involved in developing software with direct practical applications.</p>
        <p>Moving to industry has allowed me to round out my skillset, to move beyond mere programming to the engineering of quality, well-tested software in a team environment. In addition my experience as a consultant has given me experience in dealing with stakeholders and has let me better understand the way in which software produces customer value, and how such value can be measured.</p>
        <p>I want to use this ten years' worth of programming experience in academic and industry settings to work with cutting-edge technologies, eschewing the well-trodden path in favor of new frontiers where I can contribute to making the world a simpler, more fun, and hopefully a little better place.</p>

          <div>During my time at CBA I worked on an internal product used to coordinate and transfer large volumes of data from a Hadoop-based big data cluster to internal consumers as part of the banks ETL pipeline. It was written largely in Scala and built on Cascading / Scalding.
I also worked on a web-based DevOps tool developed to configure the application described earlier. It was written with a Scala backend (using Akka-Http) and a JavaScript frontend (using Angular).</div>

          Employed as a full-stack software developer, responsible for developing a security application using a Java + Scala + Angular + Spring stack in an Agile team. In addition to software development skills, the role also requires aspects of a Business Analyst, with all team members expected to contribute to the ongoing design and improvement of the product.
          Some highlights so far:
          <ul>
            <li>Won our spike day for the development of an approach to non-destructively reorganizing data through alternate storage (currently serialization, but optimally use of a NoSQL database) of database views.</li>

          <div>    The doctoral project, conducted with a MQRES (The Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarships) involved the analysis of version repositories produced by students during their work on Computer Graphics assignment projects in order to identify student problems and issues with Computer Graphics programming. The analysis involved the development of a software tool for the analysis of version histories (called SCORE) as well as the development of software engineering methods for the machine-analysis of version histories.
    During this time I was also involved in leading practical and tutorial sessions, as well as lecturing as a casual lecturer.</div>
