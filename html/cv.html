        <div class="aboutMeBlurb">
            <p>Since getting my first computer as a Christmas present (an Olivetti 386) I have been passionate about computing. An undergraduate degree in Computer Science reinforced that passion, so much so that I decided to pursue a doctorate. While the academic setting taught me many valuable lessons, I longed to be involved in developing software with direct practical applications.</p>
            <p>Moving to industry has allowed me to round out my skillset, to move beyond mere programming to the engineering of quality, well-tested software in a team environment. In addition my experience as a consultant has given me experience in dealing with stakeholders and has let me better understand the way in which software produces customer value, and how such value can be measured.</p>
            <p>I want to use this ten years' worth of programming experience in academic and industry settings to work with cutting-edge technologies, eschewing the well-trodden path in favor of new frontiers where I can contribute to making the world a simpler, more fun, and hopefully a little better place.</p>
