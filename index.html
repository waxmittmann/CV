        <div>During my time at CBA I worked on an internal product used to coordinate and transfer large volumes of data from a Hadoop-based big data cluster to internal consumers as part of the bank's ETL pipeline. It was written largely in Scala and built on Cascading / Scalding.
I also worked on a web-based DevOps tool developed to configure the application described earlier. It was written with a Scala backend (using Akka-Http) and a JavaScript frontend (using Angular).</div>

        <div>The doctoral project, conducted with a MQRES (The Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarships) involved the analysis of version repositories produced by students during their work on Computer Graphics assignment projects in order to identify student problems and issues with Computer Graphics programming. The analysis involved the development of a software tool for the analysis of version histories (called SCORE) as well as the development of software engineering methods for the machine-analysis of version histories.
    During this time I was also involved in leading practical and tutorial sessions, as well as lecturing as a casual lecturer.</div>
