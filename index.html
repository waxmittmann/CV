        Since joining Premonition I've worked on three products, all in Scala, and all using core Scala libraries such as Scalaz, Http4s, Doobie and Argonaut. This includes developing a new back-end from scratch to support a new product, including a full suite of tests mocking a set of remote services.

      <div>
        During my time at CBA I worked on an internal product used to coordinate and transfer large volumes of data from a Hadoop-based big data cluster to internal consumers as part of the bank's ETL pipeline. It was written largely in Scala and built on Cascading / Scalding.
I also worked on a web-based DevOps tool developed to configure the application described earlier. It was written with a Scala backend (using Akka-Http) and a JavaScript frontend (using Angular).

        The doctoral project, conducted with a MQRES (The Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarships) involved the analysis of version repositories produced by students during their work on Computer Graphics assignment projects in order to identify student problems and issues with Computer Graphics programming. The analysis involved the development of a software tool for the analysis of version histories (called SCORE) as well as the development of software engineering methods for the machine-analysis of version histories.
    During this time I was also involved in leading practical and tutorial sessions, as well as lecturing as a casual lecturer.

        The honors project involved the development of a tool for the placement of objects in a room (developed with OpenGL). This tool was utilized to explore the nature of human memory through a controlled experiment in which participants were asked to reconstruct the room from memory and the order of their placement actions was recorded.
